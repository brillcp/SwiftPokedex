# SwiftPokedex 

SwiftPokedex is a simple Pokedex app written by [Viktor Gidl√∂f](https://viktorgidlof.com) in Swift that implements the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co). For full documentation and implementation of PokeAPI have a look at the their [documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). 

This sample app demonstrates:

+ Compositional layout for table and collection views üíæ
+ Network capabilities using Combine ‚ö°Ô∏è
+ Async image download and caching üèû
+ Custom navigation bar and tabbar üß≠
+ Custom view transition üì≤
+ Infinite scrolling üìú
+ RIB architecture üèõ
+ Custom fonts üìñ

It downloads an array of Pokemon and displays them in a grid. The most dominant color of the Pokemon sprite is detected and shown in the UI. It also shows a list of the most common items.

# Architecture üèõ

SwiftPokedex is written in my own interpretation of the RIB archtitecure created by Uber. I call it RIBVVM. The name RIBs is short for Router, Interactor and Builder, which are the core components of the architecture. And then it uses a view and a view model for holding view states and other data.

## Builder üõ†

The builder builds the views with all of their dependencies.
```swift
final class PokedexViewBuilder {
    static func build() -> NavigationController {
        let router = PokedexRouter()
        let interactor = PokedexInteractor(router: router, service: .default)
        let viewController = PokedexController(viewModel: .init(), interactor: interactor)
        let navigationController = NavigationController(rootViewController: viewController)
        navigationController.setNavbarApp(color: .pokedexRed)
        interactor.view = viewController
        router.navigationController = navigationController
        return navigationController
    }
}
```

## View
The view is a regular `UIView` and is made with a xib in this project. The upside of using a xib is that the view layout can be adapted for iPad very easily. The potential downside is that you can't really pass any custom objects to the view. But that is fixed by making the views subsrcibe to the [ViewModable](https://github.com/brillcp/SwiftPokedex/blob/master/SwiftPokedex/Miscellaneous/Protocols/ViewModable.swift) protocol. That way all the objects and UI elements are set when the view model is set.
```swift
final class PokedexView: UIView, ViewModable {

    // ...
    var viewModel: ViewModel! { didSet { setViewModel(viewModel) } }
 
    func setViewModel(_ viewModel: ViewModel) {
        // Set all the data and state from the view model to the UI
    }
}
```

All the views are also subscribing to the [Interactable](https://github.com/brillcp/SwiftPokedex/blob/master/SwiftPokedex/Miscellaneous/Protocols/Interactable.swift) protocol, making them implement an interaction publisher that publishes all the interactions the view can make (user input, delegate calls, etc‚Ä¶):
```swift
final class PokedexView: UIView, Interactable {

    // ...
    private let subject: PassthroughSubject<Interaction, Never> = .init()
 
    // ...
    var interaction: AnyPublisher<Interaction, Never> { subject.eraseToAnyPublisher() }

    // ...
    enum Interaction {
        case selectPokemon(PokemonContainer)
    }
}
```







## Interactor üëáüèª
The interactor is the link between the user input and the view and includes all the interations the user can make. It also contains a router object. So when the user interacts with the view we call the interactor to make the appropriate interaction.
```swift
override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
    collectionView.deselectItem(at: indexPath, animated: true)

    interactor.selectPokemon(at: indexPath, in: collectionView)
}
```

## Router üïπ
The router is in charge of navigation. And since routers are decoupled from view controllers we can easily navigate to anywhere in the app.
```swift
func routeToDetailView(pokemon: PokemonDetails, color: UIColor) {
    let detailView = DetailViewBuilder.build(from: pokemon, withColor: color)
    navigationController?.pushViewController(detailView, animated: true)
}
```

# Networking ‚ö°Ô∏è

SwiftPokedex uses Combine for all the API calls to the PokeAPI. This small structure is all that's needed to make any type of request to the API. 
The [PokemonAPI](SwiftPokedex/Networking/PokemonAPI/PokemonAPI.swift) and [ItemAPI](SwiftPokedex/Networking/ItemAPI/ItemAPI.swift) is then build around this network agent. It supports requesting pokemons and items at the moment.
```swift
struct NetworkAgent {
    func execute<T: Decodable>(_ request: URLRequest, logJSON: Bool = false) -> AnyPublisher<T, Error> {
        URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: request)
            .tryMap {
                if logJSON { print($0.data.prettyJSON ?? "no json") }
                return $0.data
            }
            .decode(type: T.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
            .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
}
```

# Data driven tables and collection views üíæ

The table views and collection views are data driven and they setup their own UI based on the data they are given. So setting up a collection view data source is done like this:
```swift
let items = pokemon.map { CollectionCellConfiguration<PokedexCell, PokemonDetails>(data: $0) }
let section = UICollectionView.Section(items: items)
let collectionData = UICollectionView.DataSource(sections: [section])
```

By configuring the cells using `CollectionCellConfiguration` we tell the collection view that the data type we want to use is `PokemonDetails` and the custom cell is `PokedexCell`. This make setting up cells type safe as well. Then the collection view automatically renders that data with those cells. No need to implement any of the collection delegate or data source methods in the view controller. That is done with the [CollectionCellConfigurator](https://github.com/brillcp/SwiftPokedex/blob/493e4f78f46005da6ec6f8354888b32bccff31fa/SwiftPokedex/CustomUI/CollectionView/CollectionCellConfiguration.swift#L10) protocol and a subclass of [UICollectionViewController](https://github.com/brillcp/SwiftPokedex/blob/master/SwiftPokedex/CustomUI/CollectionView/CollectionViewController.swift).

# Todo üìù

The PokeAPI is very extensive and it contains a lot of things. Here are some things that I plan to implement further down the line:
- [x] Request pokemon
- [ ] Search pokemon
- [x] Pokedex pagination
- [x] Show pokemon details
- [x] Request items
- [x] Search items 
- [x] Show item descriptions
- [ ] Implement other parts of the API such as:
    - Moves
    - Abilities
    - Berries
