# SwiftPokedex

Is a simple Pokedex iOS app written by [Viktor Gidlöf](https://viktorgidlof.com) that implements the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co).

## Architecture

SwiftPokedex is written in my own interpretation of the RIB archtitecure created by Uber. The name RIBs is short for Router, Interactor and Builder, which are core components of the architecture.

## Builder

The builder build the views with all of their dependencies (if any):
```swift
final class PokedexViewBuilder {
    
    static func build() -> NavigationController {
        let router = PokedexRouter()
        let interactor = PokedexInteractor(router: router)
        let viewController = PokedexViewController(interactor: interactor)
        let navigationController = NavigationController(rootViewController: viewController)
        
        router.navigationController = navigationController
        return navigationController
    }
}
```

## Interactor
The interactor is the link between the user input and the view and includes all the interactors that the user can make. It also contains a router object.
```swift
override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
    collectionView.deselectItem(at: indexPath, animated: true)

    interactor.selectPokemon(at: indexPath, in: collectionView)
}
```

## Router
The router is simply in charge of navigation. And since the router is decoupled from the view controller we can easily navigate to anywhere in the app.
```swift
func routeToDetailView(pokemon: PokemonDetails, color: UIColor) {
    let detailView = DetailViewBuilder.build(from: pokemon, withColor: color)
    navigationController?.pushViewController(detailView, animated: true)
}
```

## Simple networking with Combine

SwiftPokedex uses Combine for all the API calls to the PokeAPI. This small structure is all that is needed to make any type of requests to the API.
```swift
struct NetworkAgent {
    func execute<T: Decodable>(_ request: URLRequest, logJSON: Bool = false) -> AnyPublisher<T, Error> {
        URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: request)
            .tryMap {
                if logJSON { print($0.data.prettyJSON ?? "no json") }
                return $0.data
            }
            .decode(type: T.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
            .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
}
```
