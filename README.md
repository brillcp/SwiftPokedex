# SwiftPokedex

SwiftPokedex is a simple Pokedex app written by [Viktor GidlÃ¶f](https://viktorgidlof.com) in Swift that implements the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co). For full documentation and implementation of the PokeAPI please have a look at the PokeAPI [documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2).

# Architecture

SwiftPokedex is written in my own interpretation of the RIB archtitecure created by Uber. The name RIBs is short for Router, Interactor and Builder, which are core components of the architecture.

## Builder

The builder build the views with all of their dependencies (if any):
```swift
final class PokedexViewBuilder {
    
    static func build() -> NavigationController {
        let router = PokedexRouter()
        let interactor = PokedexInteractor(router: router)
        let viewController = PokedexViewController(interactor: interactor)
        let navigationController = NavigationController(rootViewController: viewController)
        
        router.navigationController = navigationController
        return navigationController
    }
}
```

## Interactor
The interactor is the link between the user input and the view and includes all the interations the user can make. It also contains a router object.
```swift
override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
    collectionView.deselectItem(at: indexPath, animated: true)

    interactor.selectPokemon(at: indexPath, in: collectionView)
}
```

## Router
The router is simply in charge of navigation. And since the router is decoupled from the view controller we can easily navigate to anywhere in the app.
```swift
func routeToDetailView(pokemon: PokemonDetails, color: UIColor) {
    let detailView = DetailViewBuilder.build(from: pokemon, withColor: color)
    navigationController?.pushViewController(detailView, animated: true)
}
```

# Networking with Combine

SwiftPokedex uses Combine for all the API calls to the PokeAPI. This small structure is all that's needed to make any type of requests to the API. 
The `PokemonAPI` is then build around this network agent. It supports requesting pokemons and items at the moment.
```swift
struct NetworkAgent {
    func execute<T: Decodable>(_ request: URLRequest, logJSON: Bool = false) -> AnyPublisher<T, Error> {
        URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: request)
            .tryMap {
                if logJSON { print($0.data.prettyJSON ?? "no json") }
                return $0.data
            }
            .decode(type: T.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
            .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
}
```

# Data driven tables and collection views

The table views and collection views are data driven which means they setup their own UI based on the data we give them. So setting up a collection view data source can be done like this:
```swift
let items = pokemon.map { CollectionCellConfiguration<PokedexCell, PokemonDetails>(data: $0) }
let section = UICollectionView.Section(items: items)
let collectionData = UICollectionView.DataSource(sections: [section])
```

By configuring the cells using `CollectionCellConfiguration` we tell the collection view that the data type we want to use is `PokemonDetails` and the custom cell is `PokedexCell`. Then the collection view automatically renders that data with those cells. No need to implement any of the delefate of data source methods in the view controller. That is done with the `CollectionCellConfigurator` protocol and with a subclass of `UICollectionViewController`.
